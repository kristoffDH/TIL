```python
def solution(bandage, health, attacks):
    cur_hp = health
    heal_count, heal, add_heal = bandage
    time_chart = [ 0 for _ in range(attacks[-1][0]) ]
    
    for turn,damage in attacks:
        time_chart[turn-1] = damage
    
    continuity_count = 0
        
    for damage in time_chart:
        if damage != 0:
            continuity_count = 0
            cur_hp -= damage
            if cur_hp <= 0:
                return -1
        else:
            continuity_count += 1
            cur_hp += heal
            
            if continuity_count == heal_count:
                cur_hp += add_heal
                continuity_count = 0
            
            if cur_hp >= health:
                cur_hp = health
        
    return cur_hp
